<h1 align="center">Vk group parser and poster for tg</h1>	

<center>I will not write a brief description, everything is clear from the title))</center>

# Support for this code is discontinued because it is too bad! However, you can use a rewritten commercial application with normal code. More information here - @another_vendetta_news (Telegram)




# How does this code work?

1. Data parsing.
First we parse posts from the specified groups in VK. Then we download if the post contains images (it is not possible to realise video parsing with my level of knowledge). 
ps: we don't download plain text, who needs it at all -_-	

2. Moderation.
We moderate the data we receive for the presence of advertising (or whatever you need)	
It is possible to get a pinned post, get old posts etc...	
Also you can edit words that you do not want to see in the future (words blacklist).	

3. Sending to telegram channel.
Sending to the telegram channel goes through a bot, you will need to get his ipi. You can add your hashtags to posts in unlimited quantity, an example of how the post looks like I have below.	
All photos are put in albums depending on which group they were saved in.	

# Materials needed for the bot to work:	
Python - https://www.python.org/downloads/   
Vk access token - https://vkhost.github.io/   
BotFather - https://t.me/BotFather   
Find out the id of a group in vk - https://regvk.com/id/   
Find out the community ID in Telegram - https://t.me/getmyid_bot
